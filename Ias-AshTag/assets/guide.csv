"Iben Margrete Thomsen","Step 1. Be sure it's an Ash Tree","The common Ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is the fourth most common tree in Britain, and is easily to identify. It has leaves with between six and twelve pairs of oval leaflets. Each leaflet has irregular teeth. Like all deciduous trees, leaves are shed in winter, but the Ash is still unmistakeable by its black buds at the end of each shoot, as shown in the picture. Ash can grow to around 30m tall, but many are smaller and it can also be coppiced.","step1_small.jpg","step1_large.jpg"
"Forestry Commission","Step 2. Dark scars on the trunk like this?","The fungus causes lesions on the trunk/bark/branches at certain point of the life cycle. They may be dark if new, or lighter in colour if older. Most often they are centred around a small shoot which itself has died, as in the picture. Lesions are otherwise unusual in Ash trees and so this is a very telltale sign.","step2_small.jpg","step2_large.jpg"
"Forestry Commission","Step 3. Or lighter lesions like this","This is an example of the lesions to the bark caused by the disease, in this case lighter in colour. The discolouration of the bark around the shoot is very distinctive. This is a very strong suggestion of fungus infection.","step3_small.jpg","step3_large.jpg"
"Forestry Commission","Step 4. Scars on small branches also possible like this","You may see similar scars on small branches like this one","step4_small.jpg","step4_large.jpg"
"Iben Margrete Thomsen","Step 5. Dead top of tree","Another characteristic sign of the die back fungus - the top part of this tree has died, although the lower part looks OK. This happens because the fungus enters through the leaves in the crown of the tree.","step5_small.jpg","step5_large.jpg"
